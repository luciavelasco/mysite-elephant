“Yesterday we learnt about Vagrant. Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments… or at least that’s what it says in the website archives. Installing vagrant essentially does everything we spent all of Friday working our nuts off on - AMP stacks - in however long it takes to install, from a Linux machine… _inside_ our machine!”

Lucia sardonically glanced at the Pod hanging out of the Mac reproduction.

“Aaaaand then we worked with SQL!” She brightened, “After working on it at that antique tech course I’m _so_ glad to be on it again! Unfortunately,” she sobered, “I seem to have forgotten most of it. But not enough to be a complete beginner. It’s terribly frustrating. Nevertheless, it was fun accessing it from Sublime in PHP, Sequel Pro and command line with vagrant!”

LukeBot ambled in. `Have you finished your latest HoloVid update?`

“Almost, I’m just recording it now, do you want to say hi?”

`Oh! Hello, I’ll leave you to it!` He ambled back out.

“So,” Lucia continued, “That was LukeBot. When the consciousness transferral tech came out Mayden offered their employees the chance to get involved and Luke and Mike signed up. Now their robot counterparts continue to instruct us after their human death. People keep making references to this classic television show, calling them Borgs?” She smiled bemusedly, “End recording.”

SmartPod bobbed and Lucia patted it absentmindedly before swivelling round in her spinny chair."; ?>
