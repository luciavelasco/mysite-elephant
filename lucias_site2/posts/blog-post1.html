`          Good Morning, Lucía. Welcome Back to Mayden Academy.` _The computer is painfully chirpy this morning._ Yawning, Lucia reached for the MindMax security system. Groping air, she promptly headbanged the desk and reached for the antique keyboard. Glowering, she furiously banged her password into the keys. The light in the globular attachment to her primitive \"Apple Mac\" blinked blandly.

`You appear to be excessively weary, Lucía. May I be of assistance?`

She groaned.

\"Tell me about my week, Pod.\"

The SmartPod pondered this command and whirred considerately.
`Lucía. This week you have begun training at Mayden Academy for its centenary celebration. The syllabus has grown over the years, having originally been six months to cover the contemporary cutting edge technological skills. Now, the syllabus is a year long and contains all the antiquarian syllabus in addition to the latest updates, advances and, naturally, the modern holo-based tech skills used at Mayden.`

\"Tell me something I don't know,\" she muttered sourly.

`Granny Smith apples were originally  grown by Maria Ann Sherwood, an English woman who decamped to Australia in 183-`

She reddened and verbally lunged to interrupt, \"Noooo Pod, stop!! Initialise recording,\" she paused to recompose herself, \"18th of September two-thousand-one-hundred-and-fifteen. My first week at Mayden  I have studied the command line and worked on it to access github and my bash profile, I've used it to work with vagrant, on nano and to set up AMP stacks outside of MAMP and LAMP. What else....

\"We work on Orbit 5.0, which Mayden still uses to this day in smart bot form. We set up various IDEs, and although Atom looks really nice and PHPStorm apparently has its pros I just stick to Sublime Text, which I've used before during my antique technology course. I'm really looking forward to next week, I'm just soooooo tired...\"

\"End recording,\", she added belatedly. SmartPod bobbed.";
